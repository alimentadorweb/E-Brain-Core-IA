# Structure Planning: David Arriaga / @alimentadorweb  

### Example of "Neurons" Structure Inside Folders  

Following the brain’s structure, each "neuron" would be a processing block, and multiple neurons inside a folder would cooperate to perform more complex functions. Here are some examples of how you could structure "neurons" in specific folders:  

---

### Folder: brain/frontalLobe  

**Function:** This area is responsible for decision-making, planning, and risk evaluation.  

**Example Neurons:**  
- `Neuron_DecisionMaking.py`: A class or script with algorithms to evaluate options and make decisions.  
- `Neuron_Planning.py`: Algorithms that allow establishing a sequence of actions (ideal for complex tasks).  
- `Neuron_RiskEvaluation.py`: A model that calculates probabilities of success or risk based on current data.  

**Function:** Memory processing and learning.  

**Example Neurons:**  
- `Neuron_MemoryStorage.py`: Stores experiences or important data, ideal for saving "memories" or learning data.  
- `Neuron_MemoryRetrieval.py`: Algorithm to search and retrieve stored information.  
- `Neuron_ExperienceAssociation.py`: Identifies patterns between past experiences and current situations to generate responses.  

---

### Folder: brain/cerebellum/coordination  

**Function:** Coordinates movements and complex motor tasks.  

**Example Neurons:**  
- `Neuron_TrajectoryCalculation.py`: Algorithm that calculates the trajectory for precise movements.  
- `Neuron_FineMotorAdjustment.py`: Adjusts movement precision.  
- `Neuron_ErrorCorrection.py`: Detects and corrects errors in real-time during task execution.  

---

### Folder: brain/medullaOblongata/ethicalLayer/ethicalEvaluation  

**Function:** Ethical evaluation of decisions.  

**Example Neurons:**  
- `Neuron_ActionEvaluation.py`: Ensures that each action is aligned with safety and ethical rules.  
- `Neuron_ConflictDetection.py`: Detects ethical conflicts between different possible decisions.  
- `Neuron_SafetyPriority.py`: Prioritizes human safety and ethical principles over other actions.

### Communication Between Neurons  

Each "neuron" inside a folder can connect with others through communication functions or "synapses." You can implement this in code with direct class/method calls, or with data exchange systems such as message queues or events.  

**Some methods to structure communication:**  
1. **Classes and Objects:** Each neuron could be an independent class with methods to send and receive information.  
2. **Events and Signals:** Set up events that trigger responses in neighboring neurons when certain parameters change.  
3. **Shared Databases:** Neurons can query and modify data in shared storage systems.  

---

### Example of Data Flow Between Neurons  

Imagine receiving an instruction in the frontalLobe to perform a task, which then passes through an ethical evaluation layer, and finally executes in the cerebellum. The data flow could be:  

1. `Neuron_DecisionMaking` receives the instruction and selects an action.  
2. `Neuron_ActionEvaluation` in the ethical layer checks if the action is safe and ethical.  
3. If approved, `Neuron_TrajectoryCalculation` in the cerebellum calculates the required movement.  
4. Finally, `Neuron_FineMotorAdjustment` executes the action precisely.

### Advantages of This Structure  

Organizing the project in this way not only reflects the biological structure of the brain but also makes the project more modular and easier to understand. Additionally, it allows you to add or modify functions without altering the overall structure.  

✅ This design keeps the system scalable, organized, and biologically inspired.
